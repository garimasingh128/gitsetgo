## 👩‍ Vision
Getting your Github profile under a single page in a resume type-of format so that you can simply put your Github resume when applying to internships or job profiles.

## ❤️ Inspiration
We were inspired to create it when we saw that not many tools are available open-source or on the Internet which do the job we intend to do. So we decided to create it as a side-project based purely to learn and have some fun juggling with Github APIs'.

## 🤷 Project Structure
    .
    ├── ...
    ├── .github
    │── node_modules
    │── public
    │── src (has all the components, JS files, CSS files etc. )
    |── all MD files
    |── images, demo video and templates
    └── ...
    
## 🔆 Tech Stack
The project is created using create-react-app and based on React.js framework.
-  JavaScript: 84.5%
-  HTML: 10.3%
-  CSS: 5.2%

## 👬 Design and Roadmap
The [Roadmap](https://www.figma.com/file/czzHjTUJS94Rl676D8up5s/GitSetGo?node-id=0%3A1) we intended to follow is present here. Feel free to suggest ideas and opinions.

## 🚀 Steps to setup development environment
1.  Clone the repo
 ```bash
 git clone github.com/your_username/gitsetgo.git
 ```
 2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor and start adding modifications.

 ## 💻 Development guidelines

1.  Put all the code in one of the existing files in  `/src`.
    
3.  Push all the code to your own branch. Once you are sure it is working, merge it with the `dev`  branch. Let's maintain only the stable and released versions on the  `master`  branch.
    
4.  Write a kick-ass, readable, and clean code.

## ❤️ Thanks to our awesome contributors.

## ✨ Running it locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
